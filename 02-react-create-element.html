<!--Create a User Interface with React’s createElement API-->


<!--React uses the same APIs to control and update the DOM that we did in the previous lesson. But it offers so much to the table that we’re going to introduce it into the project and rewrite what we’ve written to React code. Instead of creating DOM elements, we’ll create React elements and then hand those off to react-dom to handle turning those into DOM elements and putting them into the page.-->

<!--If you’ve ever learned or used React before, you’re probably more familiar with JSX than React’s createElement API, but it’s important to understand the createElement API first so you understand the magic and can become a code magician yourself. Not to worry, we’ll get to JSX soon enough!-->
